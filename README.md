This project was created for the Hackathon PPMK 2025 event.

**Team:** HelloDunia

## Getting Started

To get our project up and running locally, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fatinul/HelloDunia.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run bas`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Then it will serve the project immediately. 

`p/s:` The id of the map will be duplicated when run a dev build hence why we build and serve the app even for locally.
